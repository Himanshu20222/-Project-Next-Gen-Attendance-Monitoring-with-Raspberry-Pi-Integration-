Project-Next-Gen Attendance Monitoring with Raspberry Pi Integration Create attendance monitoring, with Raspberry Pi you will be able to use face recognition technology
Overview of Our Smart Attendance System
We’ll start this section with a smart attendance application and why we may want to implement our smart attendance system.
From there we’ll review the directory structure for the project and review the conﬁguration ﬁle.
What is a
Project Next-Gen Attendance Monitoring with Raspberry Pi Integration?
The goal of a smart attendance system is to automatically recognize students and take attendance without having the instructor manually intervene. Freeing the instructor from having to take attendance gives the teacher more time to interact with the students and do what they do best—teach rather than administer.
An example of a working smart attendance system can be seen in Notice how, as the student walks into a classroom, they are automatically recognized. This positive recognition is then logged into a database, marking the student as “present” for the given session.
We’ll be building our smart attendance system in the remainder of this chapter. The application will have multiple steps and components, each detailed below:
i. Step #1: Initialize the database (only needs to be done once)
ii. Step #2: Face enrollment (needs to be performed for each student in the class)
iii. Step #3: Train the face recognition model (it (needs to be performed once and then again if a student is ever enrolled or unenrolled).
iv. Step #4: Take attendance (once per classroom session).
